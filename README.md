# Census2020
This project is about creating a data warehouse by using data from the census 2020.

# Introduction: 
Data from the census is very useful for data analysis and predictions. The architecture for this data warehouse was a Data warehouse with a staging area and data marts. The software needed to design the data warehouse were: MS SQL SERVER, Visual Studio, and Power BI. The Data from the census was specifically used to analyze and find out the gap that exists between the Hispanic/Latinx race from other races.

# Prediction:
We believe that the percentage of Hispanics in the technology field is very low compared to other races in the U.S. We infer that this is due to a lack of interest and motivation.
 
 # Overview:
 To design the data warehouse it was needed to upload the raw data from the census to the database in MS SQL server. From there, it was necessary to create the Stage Tables. Then, analyze what dimensional tables that would be useful for the report. Once all dimensional tables were created and populated. We're able to create the Fact table that holds all measurements to create the cube and the report in Visual Studio.

# Report:
The prediction was correct. As shown in the report, the impact of Hispanics in technology is the second lowest among other races making the Black community the lowest and leaving Asian and White races at the top in technology. This report can be useful to elementary and high schools to inform and motivate Hispanic students to pursue a career in technology.
